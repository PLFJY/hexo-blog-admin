# hexo-blog-admin

English | [简体中文](README.md)

`hexo-blog-admin` is a Vite + React + TypeScript dashboard for managing a Hexo blog from a Cloudflare Workers based admin app.

The intended data model is:

| Data | Storage |
| --- | --- |
| Published Markdown posts | GitHub repository |
| Published image assets | GitHub repository |
| Draft Markdown | Cloudflare D1 |
| Temporary draft images | Cloudflare R2 |
| Draft image metadata | Cloudflare D1 |
| Runtime configuration | Worker variables / KV |
| GitHub token | Worker secret |
| Build and deploy | GitHub Actions |
| Public admin index summary | Blog build artifact `admin-index.json` |

R2 is only a temporary draft cache, not the final image host.

## Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

For local debugging, create `.dev.vars` in the project root. Do not commit this file:

```env
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=local-admin-password
```

Useful checks:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
```

For architecture, APIs, and development conventions, see the [development guide](docs/development.md). For adding theme customization support, see the [Customize theme adapter development guide](docs/customize-adapter-development.en.md).

Preview a production build:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

## Troubleshooting

In production, if direct navigation to `/posts` or refreshing `/posts/edit` shows Not Found, the SPA fallback is not active. This project uses Worker fallback and wrangler assets `single-page-application` so production direct route visits keep returning `index.html`.

The Cloudflare Vite plugin local dev server may not behave exactly like the production Worker for deep SPA routes. If opening `/posts` directly under `pnpm dev --host` shows Not Found, open `/` first and navigate inside the app; production deployment should still support deep links and refreshes.

Deploy through Wrangler:

```bash
pnpm deploy
```

## GitHub Token

Use a fine-grained personal access token scoped to only the selected blog repository.

Recommended permissions:

```txt
Metadata: Read
Contents: Read and write
Actions: Read and write
```

Store the token as a Cloudflare Worker secret. Do not write it into repository files.

```bash
pnpm wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN
```

Store the built-in admin username and password as Worker secrets too:

```bash
pnpm wrangler secret put ADMIN_USERNAME
pnpm wrangler secret put ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

## Worker Variables

Configure these Worker variables in Cloudflare Workers Dashboard under Variables and Secrets. The project does not write normal `vars` in `wrangler.jsonc`, and sets `keep_vars: true`, so `wrangler deploy` will not overwrite values maintained in the Cloudflare Dashboard.

```txt
GITHUB_OWNER=PLFJY
GITHUB_REPO=blog
GITHUB_BRANCH=main
POSTS_DIR=source/_posts
BLOG_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-blog-domain
ADMIN_INDEX_PATH=/admin-index.json
WORKFLOW_FILE=Build Pages.yml
```

Variable meanings:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_OWNER` | GitHub account or organization that owns the blog repository, for example `PLFJY`. |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | Blog repository name, for example `blog`. The admin reads posts and publishes drafts to this repository. |
| `GITHUB_BRANCH` | Blog repository branch, for example `main`. Post reads, draft commits, and workflow dispatches use this branch. |
| `POSTS_DIR` | Hexo posts directory, for example `source/_posts`. Used to calculate Markdown paths from `relativeId`. |
| `BLOG_PUBLIC_URL` | Public URL of the deployed blog. The admin reads `ADMIN_INDEX_PATH` from this site. |
| `ADMIN_INDEX_PATH` | Blog build artifact path for the public admin index summary, for example `/admin-index.json`. |
| `WORKFLOW_FILE` | GitHub Actions workflow filename in the blog repository, for example `Build Pages.yml` or `deploy.yml`. |

These variables have no fallback and no default value. If any required item is missing, the app shows SetupRequiredPage and blocks the main admin UI.

Optional variable:

```txt
BLOG_ASSET_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-r2-public-domain
```

`BLOG_ASSET_PUBLIC_URL` generates public R2 URLs for temporary draft images so Markdown previews and image warehouse thumbnails can bypass the Worker image proxy. When unset, the app keeps using the existing `/api/assets/blob` fallback. The matching R2 bucket/custom domain must be able to publicly serve `draft-assets/*` objects; do not hard-code this domain in source.

`ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and `GITHUB_TOKEN` are secrets and are not shown in the setup status. `ADMIN_USERNAME` is the built-in admin account. After logging in, add regular accounts from Settings; regular account passwords are stored in KV as salted hashes.

The compatibility date is pinned to `2026-04-30`, the latest date supported by the installed local Miniflare runtime; bump it after upgrading Cloudflare tooling if needed.

## KV, D1, And R2 Bindings

Create a KV namespace for low-frequency admin state. The namespace name can be anything, but the Worker binding name must be `BLOG_ADMIN_KV`:

```bash
pnpm wrangler kv namespace create BLOG_ADMIN_KV
```

Create the D1 database for draft Markdown and draft image metadata:

```bash
pnpm wrangler d1 create hexo-blog-admin
```

The D1 binding name must be:

```txt
BLOG_ADMIN_DB
```

Initialize the D1 schema. A D1 binding only lets the Worker connect to the database; after `BLOG_ADMIN_DB` is bound, this project automatically creates the `drafts` / `draft_assets` tables from the Worker. Opening the admin app or requesting `/api/setup/status` triggers initialization.

If you prefer explicit initialization before deployment, you can still run:

```bash
pnpm wrangler d1 migrations apply hexo-blog-admin
```

If automatic initialization fails, the setup page shows `BLOG_ADMIN_DB_SCHEMA`. Check Worker logs and D1 binding permissions, then refresh the page.

Create an R2 bucket for temporary draft assets. The bucket name can be anything, but the Worker binding name must be `BLOG_ASSET_CACHE`:

```bash
pnpm wrangler r2 bucket create hexo-blog-admin-cache
```

If this R2 bucket has a public custom domain, you can additionally set `BLOG_ASSET_PUBLIC_URL` in Worker Variables so draft image previews use public URLs directly. Leaving it unset keeps the Worker `/api/assets/blob` fallback.

Bind them as:

```txt
BLOG_ADMIN_KV
BLOG_ADMIN_DB
BLOG_ASSET_CACHE
```

`wrangler.jsonc` only declares the binding name. It does not commit a placeholder `database_id` or `database_name`, because CI deploys can treat placeholder resource config as invalid. Bind the D1 database manually in the Cloudflare Dashboard. The binding name must still be `BLOG_ADMIN_DB`.

If your deployment flow requires an explicit id in `wrangler.jsonc`, use the real `database_id` returned by `pnpm wrangler d1 create hexo-blog-admin`; do not keep a placeholder value.

Bind your own KV/R2 resources to the names above in the Cloudflare Dashboard. KV only keeps admin-index cache, session/auth state, and small configuration cache entries; draft Markdown and draft image metadata are stored in D1, while R2 continues to store temporary draft image objects.

KV/D1/R2 bindings are required too: without `BLOG_ADMIN_KV`, `BLOG_ADMIN_DB`, or `BLOG_ASSET_CACHE`, the admin UI will remain blocked.

Recommended deployment order:

```bash
pnpm wrangler d1 create hexo-blog-admin
pnpm deploy
```

After deployment, confirm that `BLOG_ADMIN_DB` is bound in the Cloudflare Dashboard. The Worker will initialize the D1 schema automatically when the admin app starts.

## Deployment Entrypoint

This project only supports deployment on a dedicated admin subdomain. The app runs at the root path `/`, and APIs are fixed under `/api/*`.

Cloudflare Worker route example:

```txt
admin.example.com/*
```

For the current deployment, use:

```txt
admin.blog.plfjy.top/*
```

Visit:

```txt
https://admin.blog.plfjy.top/
```

API paths:

```txt
/api/*
```

If you previously configured blog subpath routes such as `blog.plfjy.top/admin` or `blog.plfjy.top/admin/*`, remove them from Cloudflare Worker routes. The admin no longer supports being mounted under the blog subpath.

## Blog Repository admin-index.json Setup

The admin public summary comes from the deployed `admin-index.json` file on the blog site. It is no longer just a post list: it is the fast public index entry generated after the blog build. Your Hexo blog repository needs to generate this file into `public/` and publish it together with the blog output.

Recommended script path:

```txt
tools/generate-admin-index.mjs
```

This repository includes a copy-ready example script at `tools/generate-admin-index.mjs`.

The script should scan posts, read site summary config, and check whether Customize-related files exist:

```txt
source/_posts/**/*.md
```

And output:

```txt
public/admin-index.json
```

`admin-index.json` v2 contains:

- `posts` / `tree` / per-post `assets`: the post management index.
- `site`: site and theme summary.
- `customize`: available adapters, panels, and editable file existence.

It does not contain the body of `_config.yml`, theme config, or `_data/*.yml`. Customize still reads source files through the GitHub API when editing actual content.

The index should contain at least:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "generatedAt": "2026-05-05T00:00:00.000Z",
  "postsDir": "source/_posts",
  "assetMode": "post-folder",
  "site": {
    "title": "My Blog",
    "subtitle": "Notes and code",
    "author": "PLFJY",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "language": "en",
    "timezone": "Asia/Shanghai",
    "theme": {
      "name": "redefine",
      "packageName": "hexo-theme-redefine",
      "packageVersion": "^2.9.0",
      "configPath": "_config.redefine.yml"
    }
  },
  "customize": {
    "detectedTheme": "redefine",
    "availableAdapters": ["common", "redefine"],
    "availablePanels": ["site-basic", "about-page", "redefine-basic", "redefine-visual"],
    "files": [
      {
        "id": "site-config",
        "path": "_config.yml",
        "type": "yaml",
        "exists": true
      }
    ]
  },
  "posts": [
    {
      "relativeId": "ap-csa/00-about-ap-csa",
      "title": "AP CSA 00 - About AP Computer Science A",
      "path": "source/_posts/ap-csa/00-about-ap-csa.md",
      "folderPath": "ap-csa",
      "postSlug": "00-about-ap-csa",
      "assetDir": "source/_posts/ap-csa/00-about-ap-csa/",
      "markdownAssetPrefix": "00-about-ap-csa",
      "assets": [
        {
          "filename": "ap-csa-range.png",
          "repoPath": "source/_posts/ap-csa/00-about-ap-csa/ap-csa-range.png",
          "markdownPath": "00-about-ap-csa/ap-csa-range.png"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "tree": []
}
```

Add this script to the blog repository `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "generate:admin-index": "node tools/generate-admin-index.mjs"
  }
}
```

Then run it in the blog repository GitHub Actions after the Hexo build and before Pages/static deployment:

```yaml
- name: Build
  run: npm run build

- name: Generate admin index
  run: npm run generate:admin-index

- name: Deploy
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: ./public
```

After deployment, the blog should expose:

```txt
https://your-blog-domain/admin-index.json
```

Set `BLOG_PUBLIC_URL` and `ADMIN_INDEX_PATH` to match that URL:

```txt
BLOG_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-blog-domain
ADMIN_INDEX_PATH=/admin-index.json
```
